    description: "Cold snare polypectomy is a technique used to remove small polyps from the colon. It is performed using a snare wire loop that is passed through the colonoscope and used to remove the polyp by cutting it off at the base. The procedure is usually done without the need for sedation and is considered to be a safe and effective way to remove small polyps from the colon."

    description: "Lift-up injection is a technique used to lift up a lesion in the colon. It is performed by injecting a solution under the lesion to create a cushion of fluid that lifts the lesion away from the colon wall. This allows the lesion to be removed more easily and reduces the risk of complications during the procedure."

It is performed by injecting a solution into the lesion that causes the blood vessels to constrict, reducing the flow of blood to the area. This can help to stop bleeding and make it easier to remove the lesion during the procedure."
