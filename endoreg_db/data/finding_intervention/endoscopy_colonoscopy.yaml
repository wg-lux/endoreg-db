    description:
      Cold snare polypectomy is a technique used to remove small polyps
      from the colon. It is performed using a snare wire loop that is passed through
      the colonoscope and used to remove the polyp by cutting it off at the base.
      The procedure is usually done without the need for sedation and is considered
      to be a safe and effective way to remove small polyps from the colon.

    name: colon_lesion_injection_liftup
    description:
      Lift-up injection is a technique used to lift up a lesion in the
      colon. It is performed by injecting a solution under the lesion to create a
      cushion of fluid that lifts the lesion away from the colon wall. This allows
      the lesion to be removed more easily and reduces the risk of complications during
      the procedure.

    description:
      Vasoactive injection is a technique used to reduce bleeding from
      a lesion in the colon. It is performed by injecting a solution into the lesion
      that causes the blood vessels to constrict, reducing the flow of blood to the
      area. This can help to stop bleeding and make it easier to remove the lesion
      during the procedure.

    description:
      Biopsy is a technique used to take a small sample of tissue from
      a lesion in the colon. It is performed by inserting a small instrument through
      the colonoscope and removing a small piece of tissue from the lesion. The tissue
      sample is then sent to a laboratory for analysis to determine if the lesion
      is cancerous or benign.

    description:
      Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) is a technique used to remove
      large polyps or early-stage cancers from the colon. It is performed by injecting
      a solution under the lesion to create a cushion of fluid that lifts the lesion
      away from the colon wall. A snare wire loop is then used to remove the lesion
      by cutting it off at the base. The procedure is usually done under sedation
      and is considered to be a safe and effective way to remove large polyps or early-stage
      cancers from the colon.

    description:
      Clip closure is a technique used to close a defect in the colon wall
      after a polyp has been removed. It is performed by placing a small metal clip
      over the defect to seal it and prevent bleeding or perforation. The clip is
      left in place until the defect has healed, usually within a few days.
